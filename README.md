# Python Development

A collection of notes on setting up a development environment for deep learning systems using Python.  I have also included some recipies for setting up Docker containers that can be used for creating isolated, portable, and highly reproducible development environments.  My suggestion is to use Docker if you can.  It will make your coding life simpler.
